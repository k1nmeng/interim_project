# Overview

This project, "SG Beats - How Trendy is Your Playlist?", aims to objectively analyse the music preferences of team members by calculating a "trendy score" for their Spotify playlists. This score is based on the average popularity metrics (0-100) of songs, utilising data from the Spotify API and web scraping techniques. The project effectively demonstrates an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process, converting raw Spotify data into meaningful insights that reveal whose music taste aligns more with mainstream trends and who prefers niche selections.

The project's methodology involved extracting song titles, artists, and album details via web scraping of public Spotify playlists, and retrieving popularity metrics through the Spotify API. The extracted data underwent transformations including cleansing and normalisation before being loaded into a PostgreSQL database using pgAdmin. While initial goals included genre analysis and relational database structures, these were refined due to data accessibility and time constraints, leading to a focus on actionable popularity metrics within standalone tables. The key result was a ranking of team members' playlists based on their average popularity scores, sparking data-driven discussions about diverse music tastes.
